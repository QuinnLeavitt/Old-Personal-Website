I hope you enjoy this showcase of my skills and demonstration of web development skills I have developed while in school. 

As I progress in my career I plan to improve this project and keep it up to date with my current skills and improve the demonstration of content.

Please feel free to use any of my code as a basis for your own portfolio/personal website.
